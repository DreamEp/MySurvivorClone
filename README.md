## 1. Initialisation - World

- Create new project
- Add a 2D Scene (Parent node - it's a place) = our World
- Add a 2D Sprite to this node (Child node - it's a texture) = our Background
	- In texture we drag our png 
	- Create a region with enabled (set W and H for size)
	- Repeat enabled so it dont messed up our initial texture and duplicate it instead
Go to Filter section to play around the graphic quality
- Save the world in a new folder of the project
		
## 2. Character

- Add a character by adding a CharacterBody2D = our Player
- Save this branch as Scene so it can get his own child and add some code to it
- Save the player to a new folder of the project
- Add a 2D Sprite to this node (Child node - it's a texture)
In texture we drag our png 
In animation we set the Hframes by number of copy (2 in our case)
- Motion mode to floating (grounded for supermario where we can fall else floating)
- Click on Node (at the right) from player script to create a group for the player
- Create a camera2D on the player so the camera moove with the player
- Create a collisionShape2D, at the right change the shape to capsuleshape

<br/>
To Code : Attach a new script to the selected node

### 2.1. Movement :

It will define how our player move (go to the code to see more details)

```GdScript
var movement_speed: float = 40.0

func movement():
	var x_move = Input.get_action_strength("right") - Input.get_action_strength("left")
	var y_move = Input.get_action_strength("down") - Input.get_action_strength("up")
	var move = Vector2(x_move, y_move)
	velocity = move.normalized()*movement_speed
	move_and_slide()

func _physics_process(delta):
	movement()	
```

## 3. Ennemy AI

- Create a new scene (+ at top of godot interface), and add CharacterBody2D = our Ennemy
- Save the player to a new folder of the project called Ennemy
- Add a 2D Sprite to this node (Child node - it's a texture)
In texture we drag our png 
In animation we set the Hframes by number of copy (2 in our case)
- Motion mode to floating (grounded for supermario where we can fall else floating)
- 3.1
- Drag the ennemy.tscn to the world scene to add the ennemy on our world
- On the 2D scene we can press alt and then moove the ennemy so it dont start on our player
- Create a collisionShape2D, at the right change the shape to capsuleshape

### 3.1. Movement :

It will define how our player move (go to the code to see more details)

```GdScript
@export var movemement_speed = 20.0

@onready var player = get_tree().get_first_node_in_group("player")

func _physics_process(_delta):
	var direction = global_position.direction_to(player.global_position)
	velocity = direction*movemement_speed
	move_and_slide
```
		


## 3 General Settings : 
	
- General/Display/Window : 
	- Set viewport (640x360) max (1280x720)
	- Stretch mode canvasitems (zoom out)

- Input Map/New Action :
	- Add up, down, left and right event
	- On this events, set our keybinds associated to those (match the key /!\ latin or physical keycode depends on which type of keyboard)

- At the top of godot interface you can switch to script or 2D visualization
